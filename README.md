# Study and Test of the Use of Blockchain Technology for Privacy Preservation in a Mobile Crowdsensing Context
This project proposes a solution to increase the level of participant's privacy in Mobile Crowdsensing applications, by exploiting the advantages offered by Blockchain technology, such as decentralization, immutability and transparency.

The proposed solution includes the design of a Mobile Crowdsensing application based on the use of a private Blockchain through Ethereum, which manages the MCS cycle through smart contracts.

This solution combines the operational efficiency of MCS with the enhanced security of blockchain.
